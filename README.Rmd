## Background

WebAdMIT is  admissions management software available from [Liaison International](https://www.liaisonedu.com/admission-management-system/). The tool is designed to help academic programs and admissions offices to process applications through admissions lifecycle. While there are a number of learning modules provided by Liaison (available [here](http://elearning.easygenerator.com/2567be59-4299-474d-98ea-6cd71551cf76/#login) ), what to do with the data once exported is not part of the training. I created this document and accompanying R package to help users understand and process the data.

*Notes: *
 - Some of what is covered here will be redundant from the Liaison training, however, it is necesary to include it to provide context for the rest of the documentaiton. 
 - This doucmentation and code was developed at Boston University around BU's implementation of [UniCAS<sup>TM</sup> ](https://www.liaisonedu.com/centralized-application-service/). Some, if not all, of the code and use cases may not be directly applicable to your implementation of WebAdMIT. 
 - The R package, `webadmitr` is provided with no garuntee or warrenty.
